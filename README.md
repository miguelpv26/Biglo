## 🔐 Security Features

Biglo required a strong security foundation. Implemented:

- **JWT-based authentication** (access + refresh tokens)
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt
- **CSRF protection**
- **XSS protection**
- **Input validation + sanitization**
- **CORS configuration**
- **HTTPS enforcement**
- **Role-based access (operators, warehouse owners, seekers)**
- **Secure cookies & HTTP-only tokens**
- **npm audit clean — 0 vulnerabilities (secure dependency tree)**

Every sensitive flow was designed with security-first principles.

## ⚡ Performance Highlights

Biglo’s frontend was optimized to achieve:

✅ **100 / 100 — Performance**  
✅ **100 / 100 — Accessibility**  
✅ **100 / 100 — Best Practices**  
✅ **100 / 100 — SEO**
✅ **0 axe DevTools issues (Best Practices ON)**

Key optimizations:

- Script & asset minification
- Component-level code splitting
- Lazy-loaded routes
- Image optimization (WebP, compression)
- Caching strategies
- Removing render-blocking assets
- Efficient state management via Pinia
- TailwindCSS-only styling (no CSS bloat)
- Bundled size reduction using Vite optimizations

The goal was a **fast, responsive logistics platform** even under heavy usage.
